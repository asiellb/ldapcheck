# ldapcheck
ldap check service

## Overview
A service check for ldap, that can be used by haproxy to check the availability of the backend ldap servers.
It checks ldaps and ldap with starttls.

## Why
I wanted to set a better load balancer service check than a simple TCP connection to port 389 and 636 for a ldap cluster. I was thinking about a check similar to a mysql-check (bash script started by xinetd), like the one described here: https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-setup-haproxy-as-load-balancer-for-mariadb-on-centos-7/. I searched, but I did not find anything similar for ldap, so I decided to write one in python.

## How it works
The ldapcheck.py script starts 2 server sockets, one for ldap check and one for ldaps check. The 2 ports must be configured in the config.yml file. The host is optional, the default value is "0.0.0.0". An user must be created into the ldap and configured in the config.yml file. The check request must be a standard GET or HEAD http request ("GET /" or "HEAD /" is enough). When a check request is made on one of the 2 ports, the script connects to the ldap, using the url, username and password configured in the config.yml file. If the connection is successfull, it returns a standard "200 OK" http response. If not, it returns "503 Service Unavailable", and the error message (as json) in the body. If the request is invalid, it returns "400 Invalid Request".

## How to run it
The script can be run from command line (for debugging), but the best option is to be started during system boot.
For operating systems using systemd, the file etc/ldapcheck.service should be copied to `/etc/systemd/system/ldapcheck.service`, edited if the desired location of ldapcheck.py is other than "/usr/local/bin/ldapcheck.py", and the service should be activated with:
<pre>
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable ldapcheck.service
systemctl start ldapcheck.service
</pre>

# How to use it with haproxy
This is an example configuration for a haproxy with one ldap and one ldaps frontends (VIPs) and one ldap and one ldaps backends (server pools). In my example, the ldapcheck service is running on the same servers as the ldap service, so it must use different ports. I configured 1389 for ldap and 1636 for ldaps (the same values configured in the config_sample.yml file).
